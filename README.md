## Product Description

Smart, Secure Routing That Does Exactly What Your Business Needs.
The 128T Networking Platform takes distributed, software-defined routing to an entirely new level. This innovative networking solution enables enterprises and service providers to build service-centric fabrics that deliver breakthroughs in simplicity, security, performance, and savings. And most importantly, it creates a networking environment that delivers the agility businesses need to move with their customers and outpace their competitors.

# Product Components
Our platform is comprised of two primary components: the 128T Session Smart Router and the 128T Conductor. Together, they form a single logical control plane that is highly distributed, and a data plane that is truly session-aware. The 128T Networking Platform supports a wide range of deployment models scaling from a small branch office to a high capacity edge router to a hyper-scale software-defined data center.

128T Session Smart Router

The 128T Session Smart Router combines a service-centric, control plane and a session aware data plane to offer IP routing, feature-rich policy management, improved visibility and proactive analytics.

128T Conductor

The 128T Conductor is a centralized management and policy engine that provides orchestration, administration, zero-touch provisioning, monitoring, and analytics for distributed 128T Session Smart Routers – while maintaining a network-wide, multi-tenant service, and policy data model.
